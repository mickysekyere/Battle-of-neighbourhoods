    "There are many resturants in New york City, each beloning to different categories like Chinese , Indian , French etc. The idea of this project is to help my client who is planning to open a chinese restaurant in New York chose the right location by providing data about the different types restaurant already existing in each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present in the same regions. Since the New York demography is so big, my client needs deeper insight from available data in other to decide where best to establish the restaurant in order to receive the maximum clientele. So as part of this project , we will list and visualize all major parts of New York City that has great chinese resturants. I will also compare neighbourhoods where customer gives the best tips and ratings about  chinese restaurant."
