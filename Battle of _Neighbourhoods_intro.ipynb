Since the New York demography is so big, my client needs deeper insight from available data in other to decide where best to establish the restaurant in order to receive the maximum clientele. So as part of this project , we will list and visualize all major parts of New York City that has great chinese resturants. I will also compare neighbourhoods where customer gives the best tips and ratings about  chinese restaurant."
